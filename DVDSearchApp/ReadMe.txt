First import the database with the dvd_db.sql file to your database server
Next open the config.properties file in notepad and change the properties 
to suit your database and server details.
Run the Install.bat and it will create a DVDSearchApp.jar file and a new directory folder called 
DVDSearchApp in you C: Drive.
Run the created DVDSearchApp.jar to run the program (Make sure database server is running first)
Running the UnInstall.bat will remove this folder.
